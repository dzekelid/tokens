Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries when there are errors, so your application executes in order and as expected. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so when things do go wrong, you can diagnose and debug problems quickly. You can change and add steps without even writing code, so you can easily evolve your application and innovate faster.AWS Step Functions manages the operations and underlying infrastructure for you to help ensure your application is available at any scale.",

Amazon Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6 as well.Amazon Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS &ndash; such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets &ndash; and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS. You can use Amazon Route 53 to configure DNS health checks to route traffic to healthy endpoints or to independently monitor the health of your application and its endpoints. Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow makes it easy for you to manage traffic globally through a variety of routing types, including Latency Based Routing, Geo DNS, and Weighted Round Robin&mdash;all of which can be combined with DNS Failover in order to enable a variety of low-latency, fault-tolerant architectures. Using Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow&rsquo;s simple visual editor, you can easily manage how your end-users are routed to your application&rsquo;s endpoints&mdash;whether in a single AWS region or distributed around the globe. Amazon Route 53 also offers Domain Name Registration &ndash; you can purchase and manage domain names such as example.com and Amazon Route 53 will automatically configure DNS settings for your domains.",
