        \   userToken      string      The token identifying and authenticating the

        \     description    \n    q *      string      A query string used to search
        for objects in the partner system. (It is up to the partner system to determine
        how the query string is matched. Match against fields like: ticket title,
        ticket body, requester name, ticket ID, ticket comments, tags, etc. Ideally
        the matching should be performed using a \u2018contains\u2019 type operation
        and in a case-insensitive way.)                                         \n

        Default value is 10. Suggested value is less than or equal to 10 for optimal
        performance.                                         \n    offset *      number
        \     Zero based offset for the first record to return. Default value is 0."
