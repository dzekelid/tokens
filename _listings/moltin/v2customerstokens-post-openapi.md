      summary: Client credential token
      description: |-
        An access token will allow you to make requests for your store. We support two types of token: `client_credentials` and `implicit`.

        An `implcit` token is typically used for situations where you are requesting data on the client side and you are exposing your public key - such as JavaScript - and adding your client secret would be disastrous. You will only be able to perform a limited number of operations on the API endpoints.

        A `client_credentials` token is used when the credentials are not publicly exposed, usually a server side language such as PHP. You will be able to perform all operations on API endpoints.

        A `refresh_token` type can be used when you have an existing token which you would like to extend the life of. When your `grant_type` is `refresh_token` you must also provide the original token in the `refresh_token` field.
