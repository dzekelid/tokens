  title: Stack Exchange De-Authenticate Token
  description: "Passing valid access_tokens to this method causes the application
    that created them to be de-authorized by the user associated with each access_token.
    This will remove the application from their apps tab, and cause all other existing
    access_tokens to be destroyed.\n \nThis method is meant for uninstalling applications,
    recovering from access_token leaks, or simply as a stronger form of /access-tokens/{accessTokens}/invalidate.\n
    \nNothing prevents a user from re-authenticate to an application that has de-authenticated
    itself, the user will be prompted to approve the application again however.\n
    \n{accessTokens} can contain up to 20 access tokens. These are obtained by authenticating
    a user using OAuth 2.0.\n \nThis method returns a list of access_tokens."
